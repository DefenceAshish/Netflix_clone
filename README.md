# Netflix_clone
This Netflix Clone is a front-end project created using only HTML and CSS, aimed at replicating the design and layout of the official Netflix website. The primary goal of this project is to practice and demonstrate web design skills by building a clean and responsive user interface that looks and feels like the real Netflix homepage.
